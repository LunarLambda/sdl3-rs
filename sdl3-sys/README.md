# sdl3-sys

Heavily WIP bindings for SDL 3.0, which in itself is currently WIP.

- Requires CMake and Ninja for compiling SDL.
- Shared linking only (for now)
- Compilation only tested on x86\_64 Linux (for now)

### Why Not \<other crate\>?

Many, many personal and impersonal gripes with the existing bindings and their build scripts.
Would rather just try and do it proper with minimal amounts of code from scratch.
